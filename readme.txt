This is an old project, so it is to be hoped that my design skills at least have improved. To run, first run the server program. Then insure that the server-ip document in the client folder has the correct ip-address (it may only work locally now Iâ€™m not sure how well the library I used has been maintained). Then, run the client program. You can create an account, add and remove friends, message them, etc. Make sure you keep the programs in the same folder as their associated text documents. It should be pretty intuative to use but if you have any issues see the readme files in the client and server folders for more detailed instructions.
