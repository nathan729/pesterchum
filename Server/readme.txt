This is the server program. Data for existing accounts is stored in the user_data file and unlockable via passwords that are encrypted and stored in that file. In theory the passwords in the file can only be decrypted with the password stored, but it uses a pretty unsophisticated encryption scheme so don’t use anything important as a password. Messages that were sent to users while they were not online are stored in the pending_messages file. The developer_notice file contains a message that is displayed by default when users login.
