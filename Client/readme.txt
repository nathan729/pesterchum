This is the client program, the one that the users will use. The server-ip file should contain the ip address of the server to which the client wishes to connect (this should probably be localhost unless this is an actual thing). The available colors file isn’t used in the program, it's just a list of the colors people can make their messages that users might want to reference. When you run the program you can login to your account or make a new account with a username, text color, and password. The password is encrypted but not well so don’t use anything important. The program will work if you don’t use camelCase but you probably should do it to get into the spirit of the thing (eg ectoBiologist). To change your status press one of the buttons. To add a friend click the add chum button and type the username of the person you wish to friend and hit enter or click send. The user will receive a request that will be displayed when they click on the add chum button. To message one of your friends click on their name on the chumrole. Messages sent when you are both online will be visible to both of you until you logout, but are not stored and will not be accessible later. Messages sent while one user is offline will be stored and forwarded to the recipient when they next login, but will not be stored after that. Blocking a friend removes them from your chumrole you can not message each other unless you re friend each other.
